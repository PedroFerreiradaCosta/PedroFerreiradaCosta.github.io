title: "Data Sharing Workshop using Frictionless Data"
date: 2018-11-30
time: "4:00 - 6:00 PM"
location: "BICC 429"
description: "In this hands-on workshop, Lilly Winfree will introduce the Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research project, focusing on open source tooling that basic science researchers and bioinformaticians can implement into their data workflows to improve data quality and reproducibility. We will use data examples to learn how to:
 
1) share data together with its metadata and relevant schema in a data package;
2) validate datasets; and if this is a regular part of their workflow, how to automatically do so every time a dataset is updated.
3) explore frictionless data libraries in several languages (R, Python, Javascript, etc). 

[Please register here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JQLTYCH) and bring a laptop, and a dataset. Beginners Welcome!."
