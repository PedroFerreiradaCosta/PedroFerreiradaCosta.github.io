Bring a laptop and your dataset and we’ll set you up to explore your data with burro (http://laderast.github.io/burro), which lets you explore aspects of your data and assess possible associations in your data with an easy to use webapp. Or if there’s a public dataset that looks interesting to explore, send us a link (laderast@ohsu.edu) and we’ll set up an app to look at it together and talk about it."
