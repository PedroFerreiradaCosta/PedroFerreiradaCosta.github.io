description: "Good data, project, or software documentation makes your work more discoverable, transparent, and reusable.  Read the Docs makes documentation easy by automating the building, versioning, and hosting of your docs, plus itâ€™s free and open source!  In this hands-on BioData Club workshop attendees will learn about documentation best practices and publish a documentation website using Read the Docs and Markdown. All OHSU community members and friends are welcome!  No prior experience is required. RSVP and More info at the link above."
