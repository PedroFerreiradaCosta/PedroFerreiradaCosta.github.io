date: 2019-02-15
time: "4:00 - 6:00 PM"
location: "BICC 124"
description: "Have you ever wondered...What an ontology is and why anyone would use one?  Who's using ontologies, and how are they using them?  How ontologies are created and maintained?  How to use an ontology to make your research data more reusable?
Come to the next BioData Club to find out!  After a brief introduction to the subject, we'll walk through a modified version of the OBO Tutorial to get first-hand experience using biomedical ontologies to mark-up research data for improved reuse.
No previous experience with ontologies or linked data is required. Bring a laptop and your curiosity!"
