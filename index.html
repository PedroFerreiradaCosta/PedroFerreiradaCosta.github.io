     title: "What is BioData Club?"
     excerpt: "BioData Club is an interdisciplinary community at OHSU dedicated to promoting a fun and supportive culture of co-learning in data science skills and open science principles. We host workshops and social events where attendees can learn and work on projects among friends and colleagues. Biodata Club welcomes everyone who wants to better their know-how in all things data, regardless of skill level. We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn and share. BioData Club is supported by the [OHSU Library](https://www.ohsu.edu/library) and [DMICE](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/medical-informatics-and-clinical-epidemiology).<br><br>"

events:
  - title: "Events"
    excerpt: "BioData Clubs host two types of events: practical learning workshops and hacky hours, often linked by a shared theme.  Hacky hours are for networking.  People come to talk about their work, get feedback, and have fun!  Our goal is co-learning, and we believe we have a lot to teach each other."
