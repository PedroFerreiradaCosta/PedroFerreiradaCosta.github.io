I'm currently doing a PhD between the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences in King's College London and Birkbeck College, University of London, under the umbrella of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions - Innovative Training Networks 2020. I'm supervised by [Robert Leech](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/robert.leech.html) and [Emily Jones](http://cbcd.bbk.ac.uk/people/scientificstaff/emily-jones). I'm interested in leveraging Machine Learning as a method for developing better tools for Neuroscience research and as a model for studying the emergence of intelligence and learning.

More specifically, by building on state-of-the-art **active sampling and representation learning research** we are [building human-in-the-loop frameworks to optimize brain signal](https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AutoML_2020_paper_58.pdf) and building novel AutoML frameworks that benefit from small datasets. Separately we are also building new computational models of learning by using embodied agents in rich environments, using Unity ML Agents.

I did my MSc in Biomedical Engineering at Instituto Superior Tecnico, in Lisbon, Portugal. My thesis, done at Imperial College London, consisted on the [application of artificial neural networks for modelling cognitive dimensions](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/1970719973967928/Extended_Abstract_pedro-5.pdf).

I enjoy doing sports and after playing roller hockey for 15 years ([it's a thing](https://static.globalnoticias.pt/oj/image.aspx?brand=OJ&type=generate&guid=704ef1f5-9f1d-435a-a0d9-31fe432a83c7&w=768&h=512&t=20190712223333)) I have been trying a few more London-adequate sports like running while drizzling or bouldering in crowded spaces.
