I'm currently doing a PhD between the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences in King's College London and Birkbeck College, University of London, under the umbrella of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions - Innovative Training Networks 2020. I'm supervised by [Robert Leech](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/robert.leech.html) and [Emily Jones](http://cbcd.bbk.ac.uk/people/scientificstaff/emily-jones). I'm interested in leveraging Machine Learning as a method for developing better tools for Neuroscience research and as a model for studying the emergence of intelligence and learning.

I did my MSc in Biomedical Engineering at Instituto Superior Tecnico, in Lisbon, Portugal. My thesis, done as a visiting student to Imperial College London, consisted on the application of artificial neural networks for modelling cognitive dimensions.

I enjoy doing sports and after playing roller hockey for 15 years ([it's a thing](https://static.globalnoticias.pt/oj/image.aspx?brand=OJ&type=generate&guid=704ef1f5-9f1d-435a-a0d9-31fe432a83c7&w=768&h=512&t=20190712223333)) I have been trying a few more London-adequate sports like running while drizzling or bouldering in crowded spaces.
